The format of a virtual exhibition aims at reaching both the general public, thanks to its engaging interactivity, as well as those with a specific interest in the topic, thanks to the short complementary research content that will explain in more details the methodologies and literature used. Having chosen not to focus on a specific location, we wish to highlight trends that replicate around the world and therefore are of global interest, though we will be viewing these topics mostly from a European perspective.

Especially since the start of the COVID 19 pandemic, the growth and large differentiation of food and grocery delivery services within large urban areas is having deep, multiple impacts: on the drivers and cyclists who deliver the foods, on the cooks and workers who prepare the food and on the individuals who consume those foods. We believe this is an area of research that may be currently underdeveloped but that is of crucial importance. In fact, the shift towards digitally-mediated interactions is getting more and more nuanced, penetrating each and every domain of human life. As a result, the built environment is also lived and perceived differently. As more and more people work from home, restaurants cook for intangible clients and delivery drivers silently cross the cities constantly connected, the “real” city could end up being less attractive than the comfortable individual bubble one can easily create for themself. In addition, the ongoing pandemic is forcing people to avoid public spaces and social life, feeding even more on alienation and individuality. As a result, little empathy is felt towards the struggles of delivery workers. Globally, the challenge is to be able to reshape urbanity to encourage in-person sociality, mutual understanding and fairness.
</p>
<p>
For such reasons, a starting point is to better understand the many domains impacted by each and every delivery order, identifying tangible and intangible interrelations that might increase virtual and real isolation and starting a debate on increasing trends and future scenarios.

<h3>2.  Audience</h3>


<p>
The format of a virtual exhibition aims at reaching both the general public, thanks to its engaging interactivity, as well as those with a specific interest in the topic, thanks to the short complementary research content that will explain in more details the methodologies and literature used. Having chosen not to focus on a specific location, we wish to highlight trends that replicate around the world and therefore are of global interest, though we will be viewing these topics mostly from a European perspective.
</p>
<br>


<h3>3.  Research Methods</h3>


<p>
We will begin our research with a literary analysis of existing literature on the topic. Since this is a new and rapidly changing phenomenon, we expect to rely on news media to get information on up to date trends and information (including video documentaries, podcasts, news articles). We will explore the latest trends that are emerging around the world (i.e. dark kitchens, automated cooking and delivery services) to possibly understand which ones are more relevant and might cause a relevant impact on cities and social life. We will also take into consideration how social media channels convey and spread opinions about the world of food delivery. We will remain open to many forms of research throughout this course based on the findings of our literature analysis, which will shape our methodology moving forward with this project. We already anticipate conducting ethnographic and qualitative research such as interviews with delivery cyclists, restaurant workers and owners, as well as observations of food districts and gathering places for delivery cyclists. We anticipate new research methods will present themselves based on our findings, as well as other possible interrelations with other spatial and social domains to be included in the final reflections.
</p>
<br>


<h3>4.  Proposed Presentation</h3>


<p>
We are interested in taking a creative approach to the final form of this project. We have considered creating a website that would act as a kind of digital exhibition which would allow us to present multiple smaller objects, images, recordings, essays or other forms of research we create within the larger framework of the problematic laid out in our “exhibition”. This exhibition format would allow us to experiment with a format that might have a more broad reach into the general public than a traditional academic paper or poster. Similar to a museum, this method would allow curious minds to read deeper into the subjects, while also allowing casual viewers to glean the general subject matter.
