Platform-mediated food delivery services are services that connect restaurants or food providers, delivery riders and consumers via a digital platform (figure 1). These services – include companies such as Uber Eats, Lieferando, Delivery Hero amongst many others – provide customers with access to deliveries of both prepared food (restaurants) and non-prepared food (grocery stores). Over the past year of the global Covid-19 pandeming, these services have been extremely valuable to people who have been trapped at home due to self imposed isolation, mandated lockdowns and stay at home orders and to those who do not feel safe in crowded public spaces such as restaurants and grocery stores. The popularity of these services within the tech sector by their valuations; European foodtech unicorns were valued at €92 billion in 2020, up from €38 billion in 2019 (1).

Platform-mediated food delivery services are rapidly reshaping the geography and lived experience of our cities and as such, lie at the heart of this research project. These platforms use “Geographies through the digital” such as GPS data to locate and connect the various parties that they mediate and in doing so, they create new “Geographies produced by the digital” (2), by determining who gets access to which restaurants and where riders work through their delivery zones and bubbles. They touch and leave their trace on every element you will encounter on this website.
</p>
<p>
For full disclosure, I have been employed by a food delivery start-up in Berlin for the past 3 months. While the company I am working for does not currently rely on a gig economy to provide its services – as many of the companies in this sector do – it still operates under the  same mindset within the tech and start-up sectors. I will draw upon my own personal experiences, conversations and observations from my workplace for this analysis.
</p>
<p>
According to a report by Sakunia & Parikh, startups entering markets with low barriers for entry and low switching costs for consumers will get caught in a spiral of cash burn caused by price wars over customer acquisition and retention (3). These companies are unlikely to ever become profitable.
</p>
<p>
Platform-mediated food delivery services are a perfect example of both low barriers for entry and low switching costs for consumers. Because the platforms only serve as the mediation between the actors: restaurants, riders and customers (figure 1), the only real barrier for entry is creating the software that creates this connection. Restaurants create the products which will be consumed and riders are often hired as freelancers who, aside from a branded jacket and backpack, provide their own equipment such as a bike and smartphone – in some places where the labour market is more regulated the riders must be given all the same benefits as traditional employees. Even the cycling routes that are used by the riders are not created by the platforms themselves, but come from 3rd party services such as Google Maps, though even the provided routes are usually disconnected from the reality faced by the riders who must supplement the routes with their own learned spatial experience in order to deliver the foods on time (4).
</p>
<p>
From the perspective of the customer, there is virtually no cost to switching platforms, they must simply install another app onto their phone. And as new services seem to be continually launching – offering significant discounts to attract customers as they do – there is every incentive to use whatever platform is offering discounts at the moment.
</p>
<p>
This all results in cash burn by platform-mediated food delivery services as they attempt to gain a monopoly after which they hope to raise prices and become profitable. Unfortunately, as the entry barriers are so low, there are always new competitors entering the market. This all leads to an artificial suppression of the actual costs of food delivery to consumers. As a result, consumers are becoming acclimated to these suppressed prices and becoming more unwilling to pay the actual costs of these services.
</p>
<p>
From my perspective working in the startup world generally and specifically for a food delivery service, the sector generally holds an attitude of superiority over traditional work sectors which manifests itself in a fetishization of “smart solutions” and extreme confidence and overpromising of their own ideas which can often border on hubris. The company I work for doesn’t expect to be profitable for the first two or three years until they reach a large enough scale of operations – though it isn’t clear to me what scale that is – until then it relies on funding from investors who hope this company will become the next Amazon or Uber and provide them with huge capital gains.
