<strong>Interview with Simon – Wednesday, April 21, 2021</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>
I chose to interview my friend – I will refer to as Simon – for this project because I know that he has used many different food delivery services. Additionally, he was quarantined two times in his apartment over the last year during which time he was forced to use food and grocery delivery services.
</p>
<p>
          The interview went well, but I felt it was slightly compromised by my proximity to the interview subject – he is a close friend of mine – near the end of the interview his responses became more casual and more conceptual rather than answering specifically about his behaviours and habits. I believe he may have shifted his responses in this regard in order to avoid my personal judgments of his behaviours, this is however just my own speculation.
</p>
<p>

<strong>Highlights and Insights</strong>
</p>
<p>

        ·   Simon describes food as serving three purposes: nourishment, pleasure and social. The social element had been removed during the pandemic.
</p>
<p>

     
</p>
<p>

        ·   None of the delivery services fulfil the same need and experience as going out to a restaurant.
</p>
<p>

     
</p>
<p>

        ·   Simon orders food less frequently than he went out to eat before the pandemic.
</p>
<p>

     
</p>
<p>

        ·   Counterintuitively, he realized during the interview that he has become very dependent on these delivery services.
</p>
<p>

     
</p>
<p>

        ·   He favours Gorillas, the grocery delivery service the most. This service allows him to avoid going to the grocery store which he feels is unsafe.
</p>
<p>

     
</p>
<p>

        ·   Simon seems to be aware of some of the issues around working conditions for employees of these services or at least he is aware that there are issues. He is also aware that Amazon is not a good company, but he continues to use the services regardless. My impression is that the convenience for him outweighs the negative impacts caused by these companies and services.
</p>
<p>

     
</p>
<p>

        ·   Simon also mentioned that he finds service Wolt to be expensive. Wolt costs 1.90€ per delivery or 2.90€ for long distance deliveries. Perhaps he was referring to a markup on food costs on the Wolt website vs. the restaurant’s menu instead of the delivery fee, I did not follow up to clarity. He also mentioned that he thinks Wolt is good for businesses. This all makes me fear that individuals like Simon do not understand of are not willing to pay the actual costs of food delivery.
</p>
<p>

     
</p>
<p>

        ·   Gorillas’ food delivery seems to have opened new possibilities for individuals in quarantine or people who feel unsafe outdoors. It offers the possibility of cooking for oneself instead of relying on the food options in the area that someone lives. Prior to Gorillas, at the beginning of the pandemic, existing services like Amazon fresh and REWE grocery delivery were very difficult to access, and people had to wait days for an open delivery window.
</p>
<p>

     
</p>
<p>

        ·   Simon expressed feelings of uncertainty and awkwardness around the interactions with the couriers delivering his orders. There were concerns of balancing safety, convenience and cost vs sociability, friendliness, offering assistance and the labour required to make deliveries.
</p>
<p>

    e.g., If he was to make one large order, that would be heavy for the courier to deliver, but if he split it into two orders, he would feel obligated to tip twice.
</p>
<p>

    This made me realize that this is a relatively new type of social interaction and we as a society have not yet learned or decided on the proper etiquette.
</p>
<p>

     
</p>
<p>

        ·   Simon expressed misgivings and concerns when some food orders were delivered via car instead of bike. He was concerned about the environmental impacts of these types of deliveries. It seemed to me that he was more concerned about environmental impacts than the physical/social/mental impacts faced by the couriers themselves.
</p>
<p>

     
</p>
<p>

        ·   My impression is that even though Simon is aware of many of the negative impacts caused my services like these, and even concerned about those impacts, the personal convenience of using delivery services outweighs those concerns for him and he will continue to order food and groceries via delivery. I also get the impression that this behaviour will continue even after the corona pandemic ends but only for groceries, not prepared food. Simon values the social element of eating at a restaurant and will seek to have those experiences again.
