<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>
I carried out several observations at different times at Boxhagener Platz in Friedrichshain, Berlin. The aim of these observations was to investigate the numbers, locations and behaviours of food delivery couriers at this park.
</p>
<p>
I live close to Boxhagener Platz and had noticed in the past that there are often many food delivery couriers waiting around the park. In her research, Nora gained access to the hotspot map used by Lieferando indicating where couriers should wait while awaiting new orders; Boxhagener Platz is one of these hotspots (see image 1.).

<h3>Reflections</h3>

<p>
Boxhagener Platz is a very busy square/park in the neighbourhood. On sunny days the park is always completely full of people relaxing, taking breaks, eating lunches and gathering in groups. These groups stay late into the evening drinking and hanging out together. It is a major social hub in the area. The bike couriers who wait in around the park seem to be excluded from the social experience that everyone else is participating in. Not only are they physically removed, they seem to always sit on the literal fence which forms the border of the park, but also socially, the vast majority of the bike couriers sit on their own, staring at their phones while waiting for an order. Only rarely did I see them interacting with each other and only once did I see a courier interacting with a non courier.
</p>
<p>
One telling example that I observed encapsulated this separation. I watched as a bike courier entered the park and walked out onto the grass, I was intrigued because I thought perhaps the courier was delivering food to someone inside the park. Instead the courier walked to an open spot of grass, sat down and removed their Lieferando jacket indicating that they were no longer working and therefore allowed to spend time inside the park.
