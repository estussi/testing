His remarks highlight how much of the joy in food is being lost through a lack of social interaction. His experience of eating at home has become more visceral since the social elements of eating have been removed. He mentioned that while he was in isolation he ate much more because he had food in his apartment and he had nothing else to do. For Simon, being in isolation changed his experience of food and eating more than just the removal of its social elements, eating became a visceral activity in itself to pass the time.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c0">Read the full interview report, </span>

</p><p class="c3"><span>Simon&rsquo;s behaviour creates traces of his lived experience in Berlin during corona times, but I believe his experiences are shared by many others. And while the delivery of prepared foods have seen a sharp increase during the pandemic, Simon&rsquo;s perspective shows that the social aspect of eating is more important than the convenience of eating at home for some people. This leads me to believe that prepared food delivery will most likely drop down to pre-pandemic levels after pandemic restrictions and regulations are rescinded, which is relevant not only for regular you, me and Simon, but also for the chefs who make our foods. Chef Shawn Adler of Toronto, Canada explains in a podcast interview (</span>

His food is now being consumed from the solitude of peoples homes instead.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>We can see traces of food delivery platforms by what people can and do eat during the pandemic. In the same interview Alder also explains how he drastically shifted the business model of his cafes because his previous menu was not suitable for takeaway. An article by Dot Foods (</span><span class="c5"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dotfoods.com/newsroom/devour-by-dot-blog/10-ways-menus-have-changed-during-covid-19/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1622059926244000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Sw6uIGyAFGFpaN54i8j11">link</a></span><span class="c1">) explains how restaurants are changing to meet the needs of the Covid pandeming; one major element is that menus are being simplified, streamlined and made delivery friendly. It is fairly intuitive to understand that it is easier to deliver a pizza than a steak dinner &ndash; there is a reason why pizza has been a classic delivery food for decades. Beyond steaks, what other types of food are not being consumed due to difficulties in this new delivery market, what kinds of restaurants now face extra difficulties, what are the health consequences of this shift in meal options? These are all important questions which are in need of more research and analysis. The rapid shift to delivery foods will have many long lasting impacts that are now yet visible but which require our attention non the less.</span></p><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><h1 class="c20" id="h.jmeeh15y2x9i"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 762.00px; height: 29.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/99image1.png" style="width: 762.00px; height: 29.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></h1><p class="c3 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c3 c16" id="h.cc08b79nonyb"><span class="c12 c17">&ldquo;I miss the connection one can create by sharing a meal.

Eventually, with her husband, Sara decided to turn her hobby into a business. In March 2020, she opened up a bakery shop, just when the Covid-19 pandemic struck. As the city became empty during the long lockdown period, she and her husband continued to bake in the shop, while promoting their business mostly through social media channels.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Read the full interview report, </span>

  </p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The above quotes highlight how, as physical spaces and encounters are replaced by virtual ones, there is a sense of nostalgia and longing for not-digitally-mediated human experiences.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Food is in fact deeply embedded in social practices. Historically, &ldquo;sharing food within a kinship group [...] was generally positively valued&rdquo;; it marked membership, gave a sense of belonging to a local community and excluded those who were considered as outsiders (Spitz, 1985). Food therefore traces human connections and creates bonds. Food also establishes relations and positions of power. Nowadays, urban dwellers are non-food producers, depending solidly on the provision and distribution of available food products and services in the city. With the exception of the urban poor, in normal times most of the people can still access food provisions and reinforce social bonds via food sharing. Nonetheless, the current pandemic has temporarily disrupted this paradigm, as city dwellers have lost their power to create bonds by meeting in person to share meals. In addition, the digital has become one of the main access points for food (i.e. exposing further the digital divide and the number of &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; not fully having ensured their right to food). As a result, the power of online food services is higher than ever, and it has to be carefully considered - and mitigated. In fact, not only &nbsp;is it affecting the way human beings interact with space and among each other, but it is also changing the way we perceive and make our food decisions. Continuous online stimuli and visual food cues, driven by algorithmic calculations, are making our eyes &ldquo;hungry&rdquo; and, many times, unable to rationally make healthy food choices. As both our conscious and our automatic decisions are nowadays mostly taken through our smartphones, we - as consumers, as human beings - must raise our own awareness and pay attention to the traces signalling ongoing changes in our foodscapes, to which we might be inadvertently contributing.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">See also: </span>
