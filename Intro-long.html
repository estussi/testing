changes that are happening in cities, as platform services are &lsquo;digesting&rsquo; urban space, leaving many &ndash; visible and invisible &ndash; traces behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We have chosen food as it is a topic to &ldquo;cross the divide&rdquo; and to research any socio-cultural, political but also material aspect of human life - and its influence over (and perception of) non-human elements.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c17" id="h.1jzw6cmmxea"><span class="c15">Scroll the page to follow the journey of a food delivery order &gt; click on the items you find

rapid acceleration of food and grocery delivery services is happening, especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing people to avoid public spaces and social life. As a result, food-delivery services are increasingly influencing both the spatial and the human landscape: cities of the future might look differently, and so could the ways in which people connect and interact with the built environment &ndash; and with each other:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">A large pavement could turn into a waiting room for food delivery workers, a train station could be a pick-up point for an informal food delivery service, smartphone screens might replace restaurant counters, our homes might become the primary setting to enjoy food &ndash; often in solitude, the city streets might turn silent and emptied out of social life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As more and more people work from home, restaurants cook for intangible clients and delivery drivers silently cross the cities constantly tracked by their invisible employer, the &ldquo;real&rdquo; city could end up being less attractive than the comfortable bubble one can easily create for oneself at home, behind a screen. As a result, alienation and individuality seeps in, and little empathy is felt towards the daily struggles of delivery workers rushing outside, on public streets. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Globally, the post-Covid challenge is to reshape an urbanity that is capable of encouraging in-person sociality, mutual understanding and fairness. To facilitate such a process, a better understanding of the many virtual and real domains impacted by each and every delivery order is needed. In other words, identifying the overlapping tangible and intangible interrelations that are favouring virtual/physical isolation and individualism to raise awareness and to encourage global and local debate.</span></p><h2 class="c1 c17" id="h.vveirex2zmvz"><span class="c15">We believe this is an area of research that may be currently underdeveloped but that is of crucial importance. </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We have chosen food as the central node of this analysis as food shapes relationships &ndash; with people, spaces and places. Food establishes networks, and food takes its own journey from production to consumption, to places in-between, touching every human and non-human aspect as it moves across. Therefore, through it is possible to research any socio-cultural, political but also material aspect of human life - and its influence over (and perception of) non-human elements.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The research aims at raising awareness of possible long-term changes that might occur and to facilitate the development of sound, effective policies. It invites us to take into consideration the sustainability aspect that has to be ensured, at labour-market and societal level &ndash; but also in terms of urban planning &ndash; to face ongoing and future challenges. Especially in such exceptional times, an opportunity is given to take action and to redesign a healthier post-Covid landscape, to better suit the needs of humans and the environment. </span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.hcdn7nl5hsho"><span>How we have conceived the structure/content</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c3">As such dynamics are replicating all around the world, we have chosen not to focus on a specific location, but rather to showcase different experiences collected during our fieldwork activities in Turin (Italy) and Berlin (Germany). Through multiple voices, different perspectives will be presented to invite to walk (or better, to cycle) in a food-delivery driver&rsquo;s shoes as well as to explore the use of space and interactions happening in urban spaces as we order from home. Furthermore, experiences of solidarity among food workers and reflections on the changing eating habits of delivery customers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>As this urban playground is aimed not only at researchers and people with a specific interest in the topic of food-delivery services but also at any curious mind willing to read deeper into the matter, additional external inputs and further references can be found as the topics unfold, inviting to spot urban traces in one&rsquo;s own location.</span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.93pu4ibjp5e8"><span class="c14">Research Methods</span></h1><ul class="c11 lst-kix_89zb0brzx4bp-0 start"><li class="c1 c12 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.hr81up83qg0v" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Literary review</span></h3></li><li class="c1 c12 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.hr81up83qg0v-4" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Online News, Reports &amp; Media review</span></h3></li><li class="c1 c12 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.hr81up83qg0v-5" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Fieldwork</span></h3></li></ul><ul class="c11 lst-kix_89zb0brzx4bp-1 start"><li class="c1 c4 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.hr81up83qg0v-6" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Ethnographic research</span></h3></li></ul><ul class="c11 lst-kix_89zb0brzx4bp-2 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.hr81up83qg0v-7" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Boxhagener Platz, Berlin - Read more</span></h3></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.hr81up83qg0v-8" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Gorillas dispatch centre in Kreuzberg, Berlin - Read more</span></h3></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.hr81up83qg0v-9" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Pizzeria in Turin - Read more</span></h3></li></ul><ul class="c11 lst-kix_89zb0brzx4bp-1"><li class="c1 c4 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.hr81up83qg0v-10" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Qualitative, semi-structured interviews&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h3></li></ul><ul class="c11 lst-kix_89zb0brzx4bp-2 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.hr81up83qg0v-11" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Owner of a pastry shop in Turin - Read more</span></h3></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.hr81up83qg0v-12" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Restaurant worker and former delivery riders in Turin - Read more</span></h3></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.hr81up83qg0v-13" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Delivery riders in Berlin and Copenhagen - Read more</span></h3></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.hr81up83qg0v-14" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Resident of Berlin and frequent user of delivery services - Read more</span></h3></li></ul><ul class="c11 lst-kix_89zb0brzx4bp-1"><li class="c1 c4 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.hr81up83qg0v-15" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Countermapping</span></h3></li></ul><ul class="c11 lst-kix_89zb0brzx4bp-2 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.hr81up83qg0v-16" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">GPS Tracking of a food-delivery cyclist - See her route here</span></h3></li></ul><ul class="c11 lst-kix_89zb0brzx4bp-1"><li class="c1 c4 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.jmusiu4tnxxz" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Photography and video</span></h3></li></ul><ul class="c11 lst-kix_89zb0brzx4bp-2 start"><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.sayromro43em" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Photo-collage of waste in Berlin - Have a look here</span></h3></li><li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><h3 id="h.sayromro43em-17" style="display:inline"><span class="c5">Video of a delivery rider&rsquo;s journey through Copenhagen - Watch it here</span></h3></li></ul><p class="c7"><span class="c18"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Our group work started with a broad review of existing literature on the topic that helped us shape a suitable conceptual framework (</span><span class="c16">link</span><span class="c3">) to guide our analysis. Since this is a new and rapidly changing phenomenon, we have also consistently relied on global and local media for up-to-date trends and information (including video documentaries, podcasts, news articles). We explored the latest trends that are emerging around the world and might shape the future of our cities (i.e. dark kitchens, automated deliveries, informal food deliveries, and much more) and framed our fieldwork to pinpoint the present moment. In order to capture those subtle elements that escape mere economic and quantitative impact analysis, it is important to start a dialogue with the different categories of workers (as well as customers) that are engaging with platform services in different ways: delivery and restaurant workers, food-business owners, final users, etc.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Through a kaleidoscope of perspectives and inputs obtained through qualitative interviews, it is possible to better grasp how each food delivery order is leaving urban traces along its journey &ndash; from the grocery store or the kitchen until our tables. Through observation, photo reportages, countermapping and fieldwork, further material traces in the built environment can be recorded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>We relied on multiple ethnographic and social research tools to differentiate and maximise as much as possible the variety of the perspectives and inputs collected (</span><span class="c16">link</span><span>). We believe that such a shifting, complex range of phenomena can only be grasped through multiple formats that narrate personal experiences.</span></p><h1 class="c9" id="h.mq0x0jt61pxm"><span>Conceptual Framework </span><span class="c13">[LIST OF REFERENCES TO BE ADDED]</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The expansion of platform economies is not unproblematic and poses many ethical, societal &ndash; and environmental &ndash; challenges (Ming Tan et al. 2021). Such tension points have exacerbated with the Covid-19 pandemic, as delivery services skyrocketed and people were forced to stay out of public spaces. For this reason, it is important to explore the many domains that are being touched by the increasing influence of platform services, researching the different subtle traces left in the urban and trying to better understand the implications. We have explored such phenomena through the lenses of:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c23">Cultural Geography</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;the intersection of human activity (culture) and location based context (geography). &ldquo;Place&rdquo; is what is created at that intersection. Places are formed from many layers of traces left by people and history (e.g. buildings, graffiti, signs, memories, smells, etc.) Cultural Geography is a study of these traces that make up a place, &ldquo;It critically appraises the cultural ideas and preferences motivating them, and the reasons for their significance, popularity, and effect&rdquo;. This methodology also considers the creation of a place to be an ongoing and ever changing process.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">With this methodology we are able to frame our research using both the locations and human activities observed. We are able to be hyper specific with the locations and still have a framework to compare our research done in Turin and Berlin by centering human activities in our analysis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">In particular:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Foodscapes help our investigation of the urban traces of food delivery, because on the one hand it allows us to include the individual aspects of food (consumption and production), but also the wider networks the single producer/consumer is involved in along the food chain. This twofold approach also allows us to engage in the political, economic and social discussions in which the actions and behaviours of individuals are embedded. Simultaneously, it also takes the materiality and consequently the waste production in the context of food seriously, adding another important layer to our analysis. Food geographies can put the emphasis on the &lsquo;visceral&rsquo;, pointing to bodies/eaters and their material and immaterial ways of perceiving, tasting and engaging with food (more or less in a healthy and equal way). Most importantly, such &lsquo;visceral approach&rsquo; critically brings out the intrinsic influence of power hierarchies to each one&rsquo;s &ldquo;shifting, contextualised and indeterminate nature&rdquo; ways of engaging with food. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The analysis can move forward with the Food-isation approach, re-materialising cultural geography: food(y) things become material agents that influence cityscapes and bodies in tangible and intangible ways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The &ldquo;Digital Turn&rdquo; in Geography is meant to stand in place of a new field of Digital Geography. Nowadays, there is no clear boundary between digital and non-digital geographies. In fact, geographies are now produced &lsquo;through&rsquo; (the ever expanding influence of digital tools used in geographic research and urban planning, such as GIS or data science), &lsquo;by&rsquo; (the influence information technology has on economy, society, culture and politics), or are &lsquo;of&rsquo; (the immense infrastructure that supports and the independent rules governing the digital world that can be geographically examined itself ) the digital, but it is crucial to maintain the approach of critical cartography, creating and studying existing maps (of such virtual and real worlds) to deconstruct power relations and the impact of such relentless production of spatial knowledge online and offline through online data production and elaboration. As data and spaces are computed, distances flattened and space and time contracted, the socio-political power of those owning data and controlling algorithms increase and expand. Globally and locally, owning, granting access, manipulating and elaborating data means more and more to influence governance and urban planning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">With this methodology we are able to add an extra dimension to our analysis by questioning what role the digital plays in our findings. It also gives us another tool to view some of the invisible traces within our research.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p></body></html>
