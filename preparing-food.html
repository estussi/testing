<em>“I think it is the empathy, the way we communicate and tell our customers what we are doing in the kitchen every day, with care”</em>

                                    Location: Turin, Italy
</p>

                                    Interviewee: Sara, pastry shop owner
</p>
<p>
The young entrepreneur Sara ended up in the food business by chance. A few years earlier, she found out she was completely intolerant to eggs and dairy. As a result, she started experimenting with food. Eventually, with her husband, Sara decided to turn her hobby into a business. In March 2020, she opened up a bakery shop, just when the Covid-19 pandemic struck. As the city became empty during the long lockdown period, she and her husband continued to bake in the shop: “it was hard to stay alone in the shop the entire day, with the shutters down […]; to see just the police cars around, checking that people were staying at home”. Still, Sara and her husband managed to continue (and to increase the volume of their business) by engaging with customers via social media channels: “we feel the personal way we communicate makes the difference”. Throughout the duration of the first wave of the pandemic, they baked and delivered food, in the city and at nearby towns. “We had to adjust our menu and to test different forms of packaging”  She confirmed that there is a quite high percentage of loyal customers and, when asked about what she feels is the winning element, she replies: “I think it is the empathy, the way we connect by telling our customers what we are doing in the shop and in the kitchen every day, with care”. Similarly, the interviewee explains that she feels that people just treasure such treats, especially during such difficult times. As far as the ingredients, she mostly buys from local farms seasonal, organic food, whenever possible.

                                    Interviewee: Mark (fictitious name), restaurant worker, former delivery cyclist
</p>
<p>
Asked about his relationship with delivery workers now that he is on the other side of the counter, he explained how he tries to pay specific attention to their needs. Prompted to give some examples, he mentioned how he tries to prepare the food as fast as possible, in order not to let the delivery cyclists wait. Of course, this means that customers might have to wait a bit longer. In fact, the restaurant where the interviewee works is small (there is another colleague and the owner; they mostly do shifts; there are just a few seats for customers inside), and mostly offer take-away choices. Sometimes, he is alone and he has to manage delivery cyclists plus the customers queuing in front of the door, all waiting for their orders. On top of that, there are orders made by phone. Meanwhile, he actually has to prepare the food. He admitted that, in some cases, he closes down the Glovo app when alone, in order to be able to slow down the work pace.
